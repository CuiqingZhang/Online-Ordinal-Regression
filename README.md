PA-RAMP & PRIL  Algorithms
The abalone dataset can be obtained from UCI machine learning repository  and LIBSVM website.

You can use abalone dataset to run the main.m
The results will be saved in this dir.
After that,  you can start PRIL algorithm with PRIL.m
The noise data is gengrated in noise_25, where error term follows a mixture normal distribution 0.8N(0,1)+0.2N(0,10^2).
